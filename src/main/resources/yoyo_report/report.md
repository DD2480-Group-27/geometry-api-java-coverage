## Coverage measurement & improvement

### Task 1: DIY

I went for the approach for cloning the function but hardcoded the branch record in between the lines of code. The data strructure for the coverage is a 2D matrix, with shape (#branches, 2). The first column [i for 0≤i<#branches][0] is for true cases, where the if statement is true; and [i for 0≤i<#branches][1] are for false cases. I also used BufferedWriter to output a txt file at the end of the fucntion, which will display the workflow for that function call (e.g. `"Branch 1 reached: accel is null"` and also the summary of the number of times each branch in true and false cases.

1. Quality of Coverage Measurement

The quality of my coverage measurement is limited as it does not take into account ternary operators (condition ? yes : no) because there are none in the original code. Additionally, the current implementation focuses solely on `if-else` statements.

2. Limitations of the Tool

The tool is specifically designed for the `testPointsOnPolyline2D_` function, making it hardcoded and inflexible. If the code is modified or refactored, the instrumentation would need to be rewritten to accommodate the changes, limiting its reusability.

3. Consistency with Automated Tools

I used Clover to measure branch coverage, and the results from my DIY coverage tool are consistent with those produced by Clover. Clover provides execution counts for each line of code, aligning with the coverage insights generated by my implementation.
